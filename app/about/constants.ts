    text: `The beginnings of Squid Social can be traced all the way back to the release of Splatoon 1. 
  Community figurehead Pastecat had been wanting to celebrate the release of Splatoon for the Wii U. 
  Inspired by the thriving Smash Bros. scene in Toronto, he wanted to bring that same energy to Splatoon. 
  Together with another member of the Smash community, he set out to create a space where local players 
  could come together to celebrate the launch of Splatoon and build a new community around it.`,

    text: `As the first event came together, Pastecat found himself taking on the entire project alone. Hosted at A&C Games in Toronto, the first Squid Social was a complete success even despite the mental and financial burden of working with the Wii U in a LAN environment. This sparked the start of a grassroots community and proved that Splatoon 
  had genuine potential to be longstanding.`,

  to keep the Squid Socials growing. Early gatherings took place at A&C Games before expanding into larger 
  venues like Power-Up Game Bar. It was no small feat facing the logistical hurdles like cramming dozens 
  of monitors into a single car, but the dedication and drive never wavered.`,

  heights. Attendance grew, and Nintendo of Canada even took notice of Pastecat's efforts. At the 2017 Fan Expo 
  event, Nintendo of Canada reached out for help at running a tournament featuring the players in the local 
  community that Pastecat fostered himself. This marked the turning point where Squid Social had been recognized 
  as a staple in the Canadian Splatoon scene. What started as a small local gathering had grown into a recognizable 
  part of the greater Splatoon community.`,

  However Pastecat knew it was time for Squid Social to enter a new chapter. Starting with Squid Social 17, Pastecat passed 
  the torch to IceFlinger. Since then, Ice had continued pushing Pastecat's vision of building a welcoming community for 
  Splatoon players around the GTA.`,
